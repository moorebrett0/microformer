# Microformer

**Microformer** is a minimal, educational-scale transformer language model built from scratch in PyTorch. Inspired by projects like [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) and OpenAI's original GPT-1, this project is ideal for understanding transformer internals, experimenting with new ideas, and training on lightweight datasets like `text8` or Tiny Shakespeare.

## Features

- Decoder-only transformer architecture  
- Character-level or subword tokenization (char-level default)  
- Positional encoding  
- Multi-head self-attention  
- Configurable depth, width, and sequence length  
- Simple training loop with PyTorch  
- Inference/generation script with temperature sampling

##  Training

1. **Prepare the dataset**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/prepare_data.py```

This reads `data/corpus.txt`, builds a vocabulary, encodes it to token IDs, and saves `train.pt`/`val.pt`.

---

2. **Train the model**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```

   You can configure model size, batch size, sequence length, and epochs via `config.py`.

3. **Generate text**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_text.py
   ```

   This loads a saved model and prompts for a seed string + temperature.

##  Example Config (`config.py`)

```python
EMBED_DIM = 128
NUM_HEADS = 4
NUM_LAYERS = 2
FF_DIM = 256
MAX_SEQ_LEN = 128
VOCAB_SIZE = 100  # Overridden at runtime
```

---

##  Ideas to Extend

- Switch to BPE or WordPiece tokenization
- Add validation loss and early stopping
- Train on `text8`, `tinyshakespeare`, or `OpenWebText`
- Replace softmax with sparse attention
- Explore memory-augmented architectures
- Log loss/attention via TensorBoard or wandb

---

## ️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch

Install with:

```bash
pip install torch
```
